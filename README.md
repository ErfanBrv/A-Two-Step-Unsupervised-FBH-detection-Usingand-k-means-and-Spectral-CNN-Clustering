# A-Two-Step-Unsupervised-FBH-detection-Usingand-k-means-and-Spectral-CNN-Clustering
In this reposity, first a train set is obtained with the application of k-means clustering method optimized via Elbow method on a CFRP sample containing several FBHs. The result of clustering provided some TP and FP scan points, constituting the label of the train set. Afterwards, a simple specteral CNN structure is used to construct the final map. The flowchart is shown as below.
